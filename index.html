<h1>Sorry, Aida.</h1>
<p class="sub">This is only for you. I lied about having leukemia. I hurt you and broke your trust. I am sorry.</p>
</header>


<section class="letter">
<h2>My letter to you</h2>
<p>Aida, I’m writing this quietly and only to you. I told you I had leukemia. I didn’t. I let that lie live between us and I kept feeding it, even when you looked me in the eyes and asked for the truth. When you confronted me, I defended the lie and turned it into a fight. None of this is your fault. It’s mine.</p>
<p>You gave me your care, your time, and your trust. I took those gifts and used them to hold up a story that should never have been told. I can’t imagine the mix of anger, sadness, and disbelief I put you through. If I could pull that weight off your chest, I would. I am deeply sorry for the fear and confusion I caused.</p>
<p>I’m not going to justify what I did. There isn’t a reason that makes it okay. I’m learning why I lied and what I was hiding from, and I’m putting real work into changing it—so this never touches you, or anyone else, again. That work will be quiet and consistent. No dramatic promises. Just better choices, every time.</p>
<p>If you ever choose to talk, I will listen—fully—without interrupting, without defending myself, and without asking you for anything you don’t want to give. If what you need is space, I will respect that. If you want something specific from me to repair even a small part of the harm, tell me and I will do it.</p>
<p>I know “sorry” doesn’t fix it. But I want you to have this: the truth, plainly said; my apology, without excuses; and my promise to be honest going forward, whether or not we ever speak again.</p>
<p class="sig">— Aegis</p>
